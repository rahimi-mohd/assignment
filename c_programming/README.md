# Assignment for C Programming 1 and C Programming 2.

#### PURPOSE
The purpose of this assignment is to write basic C programs using selection control, repetitions, functions and files for a given problem and demonstrate the implementation of appropriate programming features with suitable test data and output. 

#### REQUIREMENT / ASSIGNMENT QUESTION
You are required to write a C program for a simple grading system. At the beginning of the program, you need to input the number of students and the number of courses that have been marked. Then, you need to enter the student's Identification Number (ID) and marks for each course. Create a function to determine the grade for each of the marks that are entered, based on the following table. 


| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|80 ≤ marks ≤ 100 | A |
|70 ≤ marks ≤ 79  | B |
|60 ≤ marks ≤ 69  | C |
|50 ≤ marks ≤ 59  | D |
|40 ≤ marks ≤ 49  | E |
|marks ≤ 39       | F |


The program must show the grade for each of the courses, the total marks and the average marks of the courses. If the average mark is greater than or equal to 40, the respective student can proceed to take courses in the next semester. Otherwise, the student will get a failure status.
